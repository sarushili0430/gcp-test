/**
 * DnsAuthorization represents a HTTP-reachable backend for a DnsAuthorization.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Certificate Manager Dns Authorization Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization("default", {
 *     description: "The default dnss",
 *     domain: "subdomain.hashicorptest.com",
 * });
 * export const recordNameToInsert = _default.dnsResourceRecords.apply(dnsResourceRecords => dnsResourceRecords[0].name);
 * export const recordTypeToInsert = _default.dnsResourceRecords.apply(dnsResourceRecords => dnsResourceRecords[0].type);
 * export const recordDataToInsert = _default.dnsResourceRecords.apply(dnsResourceRecords => dnsResourceRecords[0].data);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * DnsAuthorization can be imported using any of these accepted formats* `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/{{name}}` * `{{project}}/{{name}}` * `{{name}}` When using the `pulumi import` command, DnsAuthorization can be imported using one of the formats above. For example
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/dnsAuthorization:DnsAuthorization default projects/{{project}}/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/dnsAuthorization:DnsAuthorization default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificatemanager/dnsAuthorization:DnsAuthorization default {{name}}
 * ```
