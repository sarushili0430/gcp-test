/**
 * A CertificateAuthority represents an individual Certificate Authority. A
 * CertificateAuthority can be used to create Certificates.
 *
 * To get more information about CertificateAuthority, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/docs/reference/rest)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service)
 *
 * > **Warning:** On newer versions of the provider, you must explicitly set `deletion_protection=false`
 * (and run `pulumi up` to write the field to state) in order to destroy a CertificateAuthority.
 * It is recommended to not set this field (or set it to true) until you're ready to destroy.
 *

 * ## Import
 *
 * CertificateAuthority can be imported using any of these accepted formats* `projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/caPools/{{pool}}/certificateAuthorities/{{certificate_authority_id}}` * `{{project}}/{{location}}/{{pool}}/{{certificate_authority_id}}` * `{{location}}/{{pool}}/{{certificate_authority_id}}` When using the `pulumi import` command, CertificateAuthority can be imported using one of the formats above. For example
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificateauthority/authority:Authority default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/caPools/{{pool}}/certificateAuthorities/{{certificate_authority_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificateauthority/authority:Authority default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{pool}}/{{certificate_authority_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificateauthority/authority:Authority default {{location}}/{{pool}}/{{certificate_authority_id}}
